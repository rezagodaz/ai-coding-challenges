## :memo: Problem Overview

### Best Threshold Selection

In this problem, the objective is to find the best threshold for a binary classification model that maximizes F1-score while maintaining a recall value greater than or equal to 0.9. The solution is implemented in `best_threshold.py`.

### Modulo 3 Using a Finite State Machine (FSM)

This problem requires us to calculate the remainder when a binary string is divided by 3 using a Finite State Machine. The FSM transitions between three states based on the binary input and computes the remainder. The solution is implemented in `Mod3FSM.py`.

## :wrench: How to Run
